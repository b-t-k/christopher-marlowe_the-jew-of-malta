								<span>Albeit the world think Machiavel is dead,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet was his soul but flown beyond the Alps;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, now the Guise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a> is dead, is come from France,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To view this land, and frolic with his friends.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To some perhaps my name is odious;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But such as love me, guard me from their tongues,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And let them know that I am Machiavel,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And weigh not men, and therefore not men’s words.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Admir’d I am of those that hate me most:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though some speak openly against my books,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet will they read me, and thereby attain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To Peter’s chair; and, when they cast me off,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are poison’d by my climbing followers.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I count religion but a childish toy,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And hold there is no sin but ignorance.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Birds of the air will tell of murders past!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I am asham’d to hear such fooleries.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Many will talk of title to a crown:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What right had Caesar to the empery?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
								<br/>
								<span>Might first made kings, and laws were then most sure</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When, like the Draco’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> they were writ in blood.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hence comes it that a strong-built citadel</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Commands much more than letters can import:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which maxim had<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> Phalaris observ’d,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>H’ad never bellow’d, in a brazen bull,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of great ones’ envy: o’ the poor petty wights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let me be envied and not pitied.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But whither am I bound? I come not, I,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To read a lecture here <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> in Britain,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But to present the tragedy of a Jew,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who smiles to see how full his bags are cramm’d;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which money was not got without my means.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I crave but this⁠—grace him as he deserves,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And let him not be entertain’d the worse</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Because he favours me.</span>
